<description>Provides information on server activity and
performance</description>

<summary>
    <p>The Status module allows a server administrator to find out
    how well their server is performing. A HTML page is presented
    that gives the current server statistics in an easily readable
    form. If required this page can be made to automatically
    refresh (given a compatible browser). Another page gives a
    simple machine-readable list of the current server state.</p>

    <p>The details given are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The number of worker serving requests</li>

      <li>The number of idle worker</li>

      <li>The status of each worker, the number of requests that
      worker has performed and the total number of bytes served by
      the worker (*)</li>

      <li>A total number of accesses and byte count served (*)</li>

      <li>The time the server was started/restarted and the time it
      has been running for</li>

      <li>Averages giving the number of requests per second, the
      number of bytes served per second and the average number of
      bytes per request (*)</li>

      <li>The current percentage CPU used by each worker and in
      total by Apache (*)</li>

      <li>The current hosts and requests being processed (*)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A compile-time option must be used to display the details
    marked "(*)" as the instrumentation required for obtaining
    these statistics does not exist within standard Apache.</p>
</summary>

<section id="enable">
    <title>Enabling Status Support</title>

    <p>To enable status reports only for browsers from the foo.com
    domain add this code to your <code>httpd.conf</code>
    configuration file</p>
<example>
    &lt;Location /server-status&gt;<br />
    SetHandler server-status<br />
<br />
    Order Deny,Allow<br />
    Deny from all<br />
    Allow from .foo.com<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;
</example>

    <p>You can now access server statistics by using a Web browser
    to access the page
    <code>http://your.server.name/server-status</code></p>
</section>

<section id="autoupdate">

    <title>Automatic Updates</title>
    <p>You can get the status page to update itself automatically if
    you have a browser that supports "refresh". Access the page
    <code>http://your.server.name/server-status?refresh=N</code> to
    refresh the page every N seconds.</p>

</section>

<section id="machinereadable">

    <title>Machine Readable Status File</title>
    <p>A machine-readable version of the status file is available by
    accessing the page
    <code>http://your.server.name/server-status?auto</code>. This
    is useful when automatically run, see the Perl program in the
    <code>/support</code> directory of Apache,
    <code>log_server_status</code>.</p>

    <note>
      <strong>It should be noted that if <module>mod_status</module> is
      compiled into the server, its handler capability is available
      in <em>all</em> configuration files, including
      <em>per</em>-directory files (<em>e.g.</em>,
      <code>.htaccess</code>). This may have security-related
      ramifications for your site.</strong>

<name>ExtendedStatus</name>
<description>Keep track of extended status information for each 
request</description>
<syntax>ExtendedStatus On|Off</syntax>
<default>ExtendedStatus Off</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>
<compatibility>ExtendedStatus is only available in Apache 1.3.2 and 
later.</compatibility>

<usage>
    <p>This setting applies to the entire server, and cannot be
    enabled or disabled on a virtualhost-by-virtualhost basis.
    The collection of extended status information can slow down
    the server.</p>
